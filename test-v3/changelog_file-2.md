### üîÑ Technical Details

#### Cross-Platform Architecture Detection
```bash
# Linux
detect_architecture() {
    local arch=$(uname -m)
    case $arch in
        x86_64|amd64) echo "linux-amd64" ;;
        aarch64|arm64) echo "linux-arm64" ;;
        armv7l|armhf) echo "linux-arm" ;;
        i386|i686) echo "linux-386" ;;
    esac
}

# macOS
detect_architecture() {
    local arch=$(uname -m)
    case $arch in
        x86_64) echo "darwin-amd64" ;;
        arm64) echo "darwin-arm64" ;;
    esac
}
```

#### Automatic Path Detection System
```bash
detect_torrserver_path() {
    # Method 1: Check running service (systemd/launchd)
    # Method 2: Analyze service file (systemd/launchd plist)
    # Method 3: Search common installation locations
    # Method 4: System-wide find command search
    # Method 5: Default fallback based on platform
}
```

#### Cross-Platform Service Management
- **Linux**: systemd with `/etc/systemd/system/torrserver.service`
- **macOS**: launchd with `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.torrserver.daemon.plist`

#### Version Comparison System
- Stores current version in auto-detected directory
- Compares with latest GitHub release
- Skips download if versions match (unless `--force` is used)

#### Backup and Recovery
- Creates `.backup` files before overwriting
- Automatic rollback on download or installation failure
- Preserves service state during updates

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Pre-flight checks for permissions and dependencies
- Download validation with file size and content checks
- Service health verification post-update
- Detailed error messages with suggested solutions

### üìä Performance Improvements
- **Reduced Network Calls**: Only downloads when necessary
- **Faster Updates**: Skips unnecessary operations when already up-to-date
- **Better Resource Usage**: Improved temporary file handling

### üß™ Testing Coverage
- **Linux Platforms**: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Rocky Linux, Raspberry Pi OS
- **macOS Platforms**: macOS 12-15 on Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Architectures Tested**: x86_64, aarch64, armv7l, i386 (Linux), Intel and Apple Silicon (macOS)
- **Scenarios Tested**: 
  - Fresh installation on both platforms
  - Version upgrades across platforms
  - Forced updates
  - Network failure recovery
  - Permission issues
  - Service management (systemd and launchd)
  - Cross-platform path detection

### üìà Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing TorrServer installations
- **Migration**: Automatic detection and migration of existing setups
- **No Breaking Changes**: Maintains all existing functionality
